What is EurekaCoin?
-------------

EurekaCoin is a decentralized blockchain project built on Bitcoin's UTXO model, with support for Ethereum Virtual Machine based smart contracts, and secured by a proof of stake consensus model. It achieves this through the revolutionary Account Abstraction Layer which allows the EVM to communicate with EurekaCoin's Bitcoin-like UTXO blockchain. For more general information about EurekaCoin as well as links to join our community, go to https://eurekacoin.org

Welcome to the EurekaCoin Ignition Main Network. This is the main network where the tokens hold value and should be guarded very carefully. If you are testing the network, or developing unstable software on EurekaCoin, we highly recommend using either testnet or regtest mode. 

The major features of the EurekaCoin network include:

1. Compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, which allows for compatibility with most existing Solidity based smart contracts. No special solidity compiler is required to deploy your smart contract to EurekaCoin. 
2. A Proof of Stake consensus system which is optimized for EurekaCoin's contract model. Any user can stake and help to secure the network. There is no voting, master nodes, or minimum amount required. There have been transactions as small as 2 EurekaCoin that have created blocks in the past. 
3. The Decentralized Governance Protocol is completely implemented and functional, which allows certain network parameters to be modified without a fork or other network disruption. This currently controls parameters like block size, gas prices, etc. 
4. Uses the UTXO transaction model and is compatible with Bitcoin, allowing for existing tooling and workflows to be used with EurekaCoin. This allows for the infamous SPV protocol to be used which is ideal for light wallets on mobile phones and IoT devices.

Note: EurekaCoin Core is considered beta software. We make no warranties or guarantees of its security or stability.

What is EurekaCoin Core?
------------------

EurekaCoin Core is our primary mainnet wallet. It implements a full node and is capable of storing, validating, and distributing all history of the EurekaCoin network. EurekaCoin Core is considered the reference implementation for the EurekaCoin network. 

EurekaCoin Core currently implements the following:

* Sending/Receiving EurekaCoin
* Sending/Receiving QRC20 tokens on the EurekaCoin network
* Staking and creating blocks for the EurekaCoin network
* Creating and interacting with smart contracts
* Running a full node for distributing the blockchain to other users
* "Prune" mode, which minimizes disk usage
* Regtest mode, which enables developers to very quickly build their own private EurekaCoin network for Dapp testing
* Compatibility with the Bitcoin Core set of RPC commands and APIs

Alternative Wallets
-------------------

EurekaCoin Core uses a full node model, and thus requires downloading the entire blockchain. If you do not need the entire blockchain, and do not intend on developing smart contracts, it may be more ideal to use an alternative wallet such as one of our light wallets that can be synchronized in a matter of seconds. 

### EurekaCoin Electrum

A light wallet that supports the Ledger hardware wallet and is based on the well known Electrum wallet software.

    sudo apt-get install build-essential libtool autotools-dev automake pkg-config libssl-dev libevent-dev bsdmainutils git cmake libboost-all-dev
    sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install libdb4.8-dev libdb4.8++-dev

    # If you want to build the Qt GUI:
    sudo apt-get install libqt5gui5 libqt5core5a libqt5dbus5 qttools5-dev qttools5-dev-tools libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler qrencode

    git clone https://github.com/eurekacoin/eurekacoin-bitcore --recursive
    cd eurekacoin

    # Note autogen will prompt to install some more dependencies if needed
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make -j2
    
### Build on CentOS

Here is a brief description for compiling EurekaCoin on CentOS, for more details please refer to [the specific document](https://github.com/eurekacoin/eurekacoin/blob/master/doc/build-unix.md)

    # Compiling boost manually
    sudo yum install python-devel bzip2-devel
    git clone https://github.com/boostorg/boost.git
    cd boost
    git checkout boost-1.66.0
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ./bootstrap.sh --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib64
    ./b2 headers
    sudo ./b2 -j4 install
    
    # Installing Dependencies for EurekaCoin
    sudo yum install epel-release
    sudo yum install libtool libdb4-cxx-devel openssl-devel libevent-devel
    
    # If you want to build the Qt GUI:
    sudo yum install qt5-qttools-devel protobuf-devel qrencode-devel
    
    # Building EurekaCoin
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/eurekacoin/eurekacoin.git
    cd eurekacoin
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make -j4

### Additional instructions for Ubuntu 14.04

Ubuntu 14.04 has many packages that are out of date by default, so before building EurekaCoin you must update these:

    #update cmake from source
    sudo apt-get install build-essential
    wget http://www.cmake.org/files/v3.5/cmake-3.5.2.tar.gz
    tar xf cmake-3.5.2.tar.gz
    cd cmake-3.5.2
    ./bootstrap --system-curl
    make
    sudo apt-get install checkinstall

    # just push enter at any prompts for checkinstall
    sudo checkinstall

    #update gcc
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install gcc-5 g++-5
    #update default compiler
    sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-5 1
    sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-5 1

    #install custom libleveldb (resolve -fPIC error)
    #note: this is a bit of a hack, be cautious doing this on a critical machine
    git clone https://github.com/google/leveldb.git
    cd leveldb/
    make OPT="-fPIC -O2 -DNDEBUG"
    sudo cp out-static/lib* out-shared/lib* /usr/local/lib/
    cd include
    sudo cp -r leveldb /usr/local/include/
    sudo mkdir /usr/local/include/leveldb/helpers
    cd ..
    sudo cp helpers/memenv/memenv.h /usr/local/include/leveldb/helpers
    sudo ldconfig

Additionally when using `./configure` you may need to use if you encounter errors with libmemenv.a

    ./configure --with-miniupnpc=no

### Build on OSX

The commands in this guide should be executed in a Terminal application.
The built-in one is located in `/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app`.

#### Preparation

Install the OS X command line tools:

`xcode-select --install`

When the popup appears, click `Install`.

Then install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).

#### Dependencies

    brew install cmake automake berkeley-db4 libtool boost --c++11 --without-single --without-static miniupnpc openssl pkg-config protobuf qt5 libevent imagemagick --with-librsvg qrencode

NOTE: Building with Qt4 is still supported, however, could result in a broken UI. Building with Qt5 is recommended.

#### Build EurekaCoin Core

1. Clone the eurekacoin source code and cd into `eurekacoin`

        git clone --recursive https://github.com/eurekacoin/eurekacoin-bitcore.git
        cd eurekacoin-bitcore

2.  Build eurekacoin-core:

    Configure and build the headless eurekacoin binaries as well as the GUI (if Qt is found).

    You can disable the GUI build by passing `--without-gui` to configure.

        ./autogen.sh
        ./configure
        make

3.  It is recommended to build and run the unit tests:

        make check

### Run

Then you can either run the command-line daemon using `src/eurekacoind` and `src/eurekacoin-cli`, or you can run the Qt GUI using `src/qt/eurekacoin-qt`

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/eurekacoin/eurekacoin/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of EurekaCoin.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Developer IRC can be found on Freenode at #eurekacoin-dev.

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write [unit tests](src/test/README.md) for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code. Unit tests can be compiled and run
(assuming they weren't disabled in configure) with: `make check`. Further details on running
and extending unit tests can be found in [/src/test/README.md](/src/test/README.md).

There are also [regression and integration tests](/qa) of the RPC interface, written
in Python, that are run automatically on the build server.
These tests can be run (if the [test dependencies](/qa) are installed) with: `qa/pull-tester/rpc-tests.py`

### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.
